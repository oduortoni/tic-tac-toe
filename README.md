# Tic Tac Toe

## Description

The program is a digitized version of a game I used to play back in high school. Unlike the more popular version that involves an empty grid, this version begins with all the pieces you will ever need. What is then left is a way to move things in a way that guarantees a player victory. 

There are two ways to play the game: the first is a multiplayer version and the next is with the computer.
